### 🛠 what you’ll find here
- side projects that started strong and faded
- experimental stuff with React, JS, and idk
- things i built just to learn something

### 💼 currently
software engineering intern @ [DirectFN](https://www.directfn.com)  
working with React on projects that quietly power parts of finance in Pakistan & the Gulf
i’ve been lucky to peek into some surprisingly sensitive codebases — full apps, internal tools, and databases most folks won’t see.

### 🌐 website
[abdull-ah-med.xyz](https://abdull-ah-med.xyz/) — portfolio, contact, and other internet things

### 🧠 skills? sorta
- frontend: React, Tailwind
- backend basics: Node, Express, MongoDB
- version control chaos: `git`

### 🧳 what i'm into lately
- probably working on something right now  
- probably not documenting it
- it's probably not working
- pushing straight to `main` like it’s 2010
- 
- ### 🧩 what i'm into lately
- building cleaner, faster interfaces with React  
- exploring component patterns that don’t lead to chaos
- occasionally poking around backend stuff, just enough to break and fix things
