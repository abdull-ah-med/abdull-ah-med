# Hello there! 👋

I am Abdullah Ahmed. I consider myself to be smart (or at least a try to be) worker, and I try my best to learn from where I can, whenever I can. I always believe that there is room for improvement in whatever I do, and I try to strive for doing the best I can.

### 🌱 What do I do?
- ✔️ I am doing Bachelors in Computer Science, from University of Engineering and Technology Lahore. I am currently in 2nd year of my degree program.

- ✔️I'm a fast learner, looking to break into the fields of Cyber Security or FinTech. These two fields have always been my passion, and I hope to make a career in either (both if I am lucky) of them. I am currently working on building my base in Cyber Security, by doing courses and trying to again as much knowledge as I can from people who are already working in this industry.

- ✔️Also, my interest in FinTech stems from my interest in Accounting / Finance. Finance has always been a point of interest for me. If I was doing computer science, then I would've surely gone into finance side. I still want to give it a shot, and I plan to attempt CFA exams after my Bachelors.

### 👯 My other interests
I am very intrigued by trading. I also trade cryptocurrencies and keep on learning and trying to be a better trader.
