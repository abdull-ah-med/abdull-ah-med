### About Me
I’m a final-year software engineering student with an interest in full stack development and applied machine learning.
I recently worked as a Software Engineering Intern at [DirectFN](https://www.directfn.com), where I contributed to financial systems used across Pakistan and the Gulf.

Currently, I am focused on building scalable backends using **Clean Architecture** in **ASP.NET Core**, handling secure **AuthN/AuthZ** implementations, and deploying to **Azure**. I am also exploring the intersection of **NLP** and software design, specifically working with **LLMs**, **Vector Search**, and **AI Agent patterns**.

### Skills
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core (Clean Architecture), C#, Node.js
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Azure, Github Actions, CI/CD
- **AI & NLP:** LLM Integration, Vector Search (RAG), Python
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Vector Databases
