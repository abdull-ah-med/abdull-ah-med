### what you’ll find here

- projects that started with ambition and ended with `// TODO`
- things i don't remember doing
- a mix of personal work and stuff built just to learn something


### currently
- software engineering intern @ [DirectFN](https://www.directfn.com)  
- mostly building with react.  
- sometimes looking at codebases that run financial systems across pakistan and parts of the gulf.  

### website
- [here](https://abdull-ah-med.xyz/) — portfolio, contact, and other internet things

### skills? sorta
- frontend: React, Tailwind
- backend basics: Node, Express, MongoDB
- tools: git, vs code, ctrl+z, c, v
### what am i building rn:
- formai: build form from a prompt
- [test prod](https://p-0.vercel.app) ion like setting up dev environments
- [prod prod](formai-silk.vercel.app)
### what i'm into lately
- building cleaner, faster interfaces with React  
- building things that feel fast  
- occasionally poking around backend stuff, just enough to break and fix things

### side notes
- probably working on something right now  
- probably not documenting it
- it's probably not working
- pushing straight to `main` like it’s 2010
